Tonight<br>
I'm gonna have myself a real good time<br>
I feel alive<br>
And the world, I'll turn it inside out<br>
Yeah!<br>
I'm floating around<br>
In ecstasy<br>
<br>
So don't stop me now, don't stop me<br>
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time<br>
<br>
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky<br>
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity<br>
I'm a racing car passing by<br>
Like Lady Godiva<br>
I'm gonna go go go<br>
There's no stopping me<br>
<br>
I'm burning through the sky<br>
Yeah!<br>
Two hundred degrees<br>
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit<br>
I'm traveling at the speed of light<br>
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you<br>
<br>
Don't stop me now<br>
I'm having such a good time<br>
I'm having a ball<br>
Don't stop me now<br>
If you wanna have a good time<br>
Just give me a call<br>
<br>
Don't stop me now<br>
'Cause I'm having a good time<br>
Don't stop me now<br>
Yes I'm having a good time<br>
I don't want to stop at all, yeah!<br>
<br>
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars<br>
On a collision course<br>
I am a satellite<br>
I'm out of control<br>
I am a sex machine ready to reload<br>
Like an atom bomb about to-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh explode<br>
<br>
I'm burning through the sky<br>
Yeah!<br>
Two hundred degrees<br>
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit<br>
I'm traveling at the speed of light<br>
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you<br>
<br>
Don't stop me<br>
Don't stop me<br>
Don't stop me<br>
Hey hey hey!<br>
<br>
Don't stop me<br>
Don't stop me<br>
Ooh ooh ooh<br>
I like it<br>
<br>
Don't stop me<br>
Don't stop me<br>
Have a good time, good time<br>
<br>
Don't stop me<br>
Don't stop me<br>
<br>
Ooh ooh alright<br>
<br>
Ooh I'm burning through the sky<br>
Yeah!<br>
Two hundred degrees<br>
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit<br>
I'm traveling at the speed of light<br>
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you<br>
<br>
Don't stop me now<br>
I'm having such a good time<br>
I'm having a ball<br>
Don't stop me now<br>
If you wanna have a good time<br>
Alright<br>
Just give me a call<br>
<br>
Don't stop me now<br>
'Cause I'm having a good time<br>
Don't stop me now<br>
Yes, I'm having a good time<br>
I don't wanna stop at all
